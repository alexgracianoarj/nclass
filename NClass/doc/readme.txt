NClass 2.02
===========

Overview
--------
NClass is a free tool to easily create UML class diagrams with full C# and Java 
language support. The user interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly 
for easy and fast development. Properties, enums, delegates and other language 
specific elements are fully supported with strict syntactical and semantical 
verification. 

Design your application with just a few clicks - the main goal is to provide a 
simple but powerful class designer that is very intuitive to use. Diagram styles 
help you to create professional looking diagrams, just like in Visual Studio or 
other commercial products. Furthermore, you can generate code from your models or 
you can also import classes from existing .NET assemblies.
